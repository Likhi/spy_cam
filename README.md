## What is this?

People were stealing stuff from my office desk overnight. AND they were messing up my desk's cleanliness.

This uses your webcam to take the offender's picture.

## Maybe run these:

python -m venv venv

.\venv\scripts\activate

python -m pip install --upgrade pip

## Then, definitely run this:

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

## Now what?

Run the script using: python spy_cam.py

## Anything else?

LOG.log notes when the script has taken a picture, using the filename (which has a timestamp in it).
